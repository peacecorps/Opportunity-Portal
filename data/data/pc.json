The project's purpose is: \"To facilitate the sustainable management of communities\u00d5 natural resources through education and community action in order to conserve the local environment and improve peoples\u00d5 livelihoods.\" Community Environmental Education Volunteers will be assigned to work with three local elementary schools. The activities they develop will work towards this purpose by focusing on the following goals:\r\r\r\rGOAL 1:  Rural school teachers will improve their technical skills to teach environmental education and primary school students will increase their knowledge and skills to conserve natural resources in their communities. \r\rVolunteers implement the following tasks to meet this goal:\r\r1. Classroom co-teaching: Volunteers demonstrate and model participatory approaches and the inclusion of environmental topics in all courses. Volunteers co-teach in public primary schools, co-plan and train teachers in participatory, community-level environmental activities to achieve this. Methodologies: classroom management, positive reinforcement, community research activities.\r\r2. Environmental-technical activities: trash separation, gardening techniques, composting, nursery establishment. \r\r3. Composting, Gardening Activities, and nurseries: Volunteers train teachers in practical skills to carry out these activities in the school.\r\rGOAL 2: Community-Based groups and organizations will have improved their technical and organizational capacity and implemented projects to conserve the local environment.\r\rVolunteers participate in the following development activities to meet this goal:\r\r1.Support community organizations in their sites: Volunteers support parent organizations, ecological brigades and/or local environmental commissions to improve their organizational capacity (i.e. annual plans, local coordination with other organizations). \r\r2.Youth ecological brigade training: Volunteers will train and facilitate the organization of groups working towards local community environmental issues.  The brigades/clubs are formed by Nicaraguan youth, ages 10-17. Activity examples include trash campaigns in the school(s) and in the community to reduce organic solid waste, environmental awareness campaigns related to the importance of sustainable household water use and celebration of World Environmental Day (June 5).\r\r3.Environmental conservation activities: environmental talks, establishment of small community fruit/wood trees nurseries or vegetable gardens with composting, reforestation campaigns, ecological/educational murals, and/or proper trash disposal."}, {"AA": 104, "sector": "Environment", "STAGING": "17-Sep-14", "language": "Spanish 1", "REQ ID": "1844BR", "live_cond": "Extreme Heat,Live with homestay portion of service,Must be able to bicycle long distances", "FY": "FY2014", "title": "526EN02 Environmental Conservation", "skills": "All candidates are strongly preferred to be able to manage youth, teacher, farmer, kid groups as well as have the ability to work with local elected officials and government/NGO workers.

Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system.\r\r\r\rElectricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market.\r\r\r\rWorking Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common.\r\r\r\rRoads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi.\r\r\r\rTelecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers.\r\r\r\rClimate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months.\r\r\r\rArmenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum \u00d2business casual\u00d3 \u00d0 for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.", "current_req_status": "Open", "proj_desc": "Background: Peace Corps began programming in the spring of 1992 at the request of the Government of Armenia to support their efforts to improve the quality of English language education in schools and universities, and assist in the transition to a market-based economy. For nearly two decades, Peace Corps had projects in small business and community development, and in 2012 turned its focus to community and youth development based on a review of country needs and changing priorities aimed at youth. As such, Peace Corps\u00d5s Community and Youth Development project (CYD) places Volunteers in communities throughout Armenia to work towards the accomplishment of two goals:\r\r\r\rGoal 1: Increase the internal capacity and professionalism of organizations\r\rVolunteers provide human and institutional capacity development assistance for Armenian organizations to improve their internal governance practices, professionalize outward-focused activities such as marketing and public relations, better assess community issues and develop strategies for their resolution, and utilize local assets and resources to progress toward financial sustainability. Volunteers may find themselves helping an organization improve its human resource management practices by assisting in writing job descriptions and implementing professional development plans for the staff. As well, they assist organizations to improve their planning, implementation, and monitoring & evaluation of community projects.\r\r\r\rGoal 2: Implement programs that lead to positive youth development\r\rThrough various programs, clubs, and workshops for youth, Peace Corps Volunteers aim to transfer valuable personal and professional skills to Armenia\u00d5s youth in order to enhance their capacity as leaders in their communities, promote service-based learning, and assist with career skills development. Volunteers may organize entrepreneurship camps for youth that focus on small-business skills and business plan preparation. They might create after-school activities that teach leadership skills to youth through civic engagement and community development projects. Through leading by example, Peace Corps Volunteers can serve as coaches and mentors for the community youth."}, {"AA": 145, "sector": "Business", "STAGING": "15-Jul-14", "language": "Spanish 2", "REQ ID": "1811BR", "live_cond": "Live with homestay family for duration of service", "FY": "FY2014", "title": "519SB01 Community Organizational & Economic Development", "skills": "VSI REQUIREMENTS APPLY\r\r\r\r\r\r** Creative, dynamic, and enthusiastic\r\r** Proactive \r\r** Ability to transfer skills to undereducated populations and/or community groups in a variety of topics\r\r** Patience and persistence\r\r** Willingness to live in extremely rural and humble conditions\r\r** Ability to motivate and inspire others\r\r** Community Organization/Participation Skills \r\r** Interest and willingness in coordinating efforts w/ NGOs, local governments and other institutions\r\r** Liaising between community groups and outside institutions\r\r** Self-starter; ability to \u00d2create\u00d3 work\r\r** Training skills\r\r** Good people skills\r\r** Culturally sensitive/respectful", "Q": "Quarter 4", "num_vol": 3, "location": "El Salvador", "invite_deadline": "17-Mar-14", "nominate_deadline": "16-Jan-14", "live_cond_comm": "El Salvador is a tropical country; Volunteers should be prepared for extreme temperatures in some sites (up to 104o F) as well as very few cold areas (60o F) and heavy storms during the rainy season.

The purpose of the Healthy Communities Project (HC) is to improve individual and family health of low-income Dominicans living in rural and marginal urban communities through the adoption of healthy decisions and practices. This purpose is consistent with on-going national plans of the private and public sector to reduce maternal/child and youth mortality in low-income families living in rural and marginal urban villages. This purpose is being accomplished through the organization and training of a network of 286 youth groups (Escojo)for the promotion of healthy decisions (HIV prevention in youth and prevention of early pregnancy in adolescents) and 120 mothers groups (Healthy Homes) for the promotion of healthy practices at the family level. Annually, every youth groups has the capacity of orienting an average of 100 youth (Student and nonstudents) and every mothers group have the capacity of certifying 30 families as Healthy Families through home visits.

The purpose of the Healthy Communities Project (HC) is to improve individual and family health of low-income Dominicans living in rural and marginal urban communities through the adoption of healthy decisions and practices. This purpose is consistent with on-going national plans of the private and public sector to reduce maternal/child and youth mortality in low-income families living in rural and marginal urban villages. This purpose is being accomplished through the organization and training of a network of 286 youth groups (Escojo)for the promotion of healthy decisions (HIV prevention in youth and prevention of early pregnancy in adolescents) and 120 mothers groups (Healthy Homes) for the promotion of healthy practices at the family level. Annually, every youth groups has the capacity of orienting an average of 100 youth (Student and nonstudents) and every mothers group have the capacity of certifying 30 families as Healthy Families through home visits.

Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.\r\r\r\rWinter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system.\r\r\r\rElectricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market.\r\r\r\rWorking Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common.\r\r\r\rRoads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi.\r\r\r\rTelecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.

As a community environmental education promoters, Volunteers work at the community level in coordination with teachers, community associations and government, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Volunteers are currently concentrated in five departments: Le\u0097n, Chinandega, Boaco, Rivas, and Matagalpa.  \r\r\r\rNicaragua\u00d5s private, public, and non-profit sectors are concerned about the country\u00d5s rapid rate of deforestation and soil erosion that has taken place over the last 25 years. The deforestation is the result of subsistence (slash and burn) farming combined with a growing, market-based agricultural sector, woodcutting and charcoal production to produce traditional fuels. These problems are compounded due to the fact that natural resources are poorly utilized and basic, government-provided services are limited. Community initiatives to address these problems are inhibited by the low income of rural inhabitants and a lack of education related to environmental issues. \r\r\r\rThe Community Environmental Education Project has a formal agreement with MINED and as partners our organizations have the following framework.  The project''s purpose is: \"To facilitate the sustainable management of communities\u00d5 natural resources through education and community action in order to conserve the local environment and improve peoples\u00d5 livelihoods.\" Community Environmental Education Volunteers will be assigned to work with three local elementary schools. The activities they develop will work towards this purpose by focusing on the following goals:\r\r\r\rGOAL 1:  Rural school teachers will improve their technical skills to teach environmental education and primary school students will increase their knowledge and skills to conserve natural resources in their communities. \r\r\r\rVolunteers implement the following tasks to meet this goal:\r\r1. Classroom co-teaching: Volunteers demonstrate and model participatory approaches and the inclusion of environmental topics in all courses. Volunteers co-teach in public primary schools, co-plan and train teachers in participatory, community-level environmental activities to achieve this. Methodologies: classroom management, positive reinforcement, community research activities.\r\r\r\r2. Environmental-technical activities: trash separation, gardening techniques, composting, nursery establishment. \r\r\r\r3. Composting, Gardening Activities, and nurseries: Volunteers train teachers in practical skills to carry out these activities in the school.\r\r\r\rGOAL 2: Community-Based groups and organizations will have improved their technical and organizational capacity and implemented projects to conserve the local environment.\r\r\r\rVolunteers participate in the following development activities to meet this goal:\r\r1. Support community organizations in their sites: Volunteers support parent organizations, ecological brigades and/or local environmental commissions to improve their organizational capacity (i.e. annual plans, local coordination with other organizations). \r\r\r\r2.Youth ecological brigade training: Volunteers will train and facilitate the organization of groups working towards local community environmental issues.  The brigades/clubs are formed by Nicaraguan youth, ages 10-17. Activity examples include trash campaigns in the school(s) and in the community to reduce organic solid waste, environmental awareness campaigns related to the importance of sustainable household water use and celebration of World Environmental Day (June 5).\r\r\r\r3.Environmental conservation activities: environmental talks, establishment of small community fruit/wood trees nurseries or vegetable gardens with composting, reforestation campaigns, ecological/educational murals, and/or proper trash disposal."}, {"AA": 171, "sector": "Education", "STAGING": "25-Aug-14", "language": null, "REQ ID": "1795BR", "live_cond": "Other,Uneven terrain,Physically challenging,High altitude,Live with homestay family for duration of service,Isolated site,Long cold winters,May be challenging for minorities", "FY": "FY2014", "title": "305ED01 TEFL", "skills": "AA171 focuses on English language instruction in secondary schools; mostly in rural villages.

Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.\r\r\r\rWinter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system.\r\r\r\rElectricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market.\r\r\r\rWorking Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common.\r\r\r\rRoads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi.\r\r\r\rTelecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers.\r\r\r\rClimate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.

Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months.\r\r\r\rArmenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat.

As such the project works with the Ministry of Education and Science through the National Institute of Education (NIE) to support the English language education strategy. This involves training teachers to use modern English language teaching methodologies and enhancing their English language use in the classroom. The overall purpose of the project is that students and teachers will gain improved access to personal, professional, and academic opportunities through increased English language proficiency. Defined further, the two goals of the Peace Corps\u00d5s TEFL project in Armenia are:\r\r\r\rGoal 1: Teachers will improve their overall level of effectiveness through improving their English language proficiency and implementing student-centered teaching techniques.\r\r\r\rGoal 2: Learners of English throughout Armenia will develop/improve their English language proficiency, critical thinking skills and overall academic success through improved interactive classroom instruction and extra-curricular activities facilitated by Peace Corps volunteers and their counterparts.\r\r\r\rTEFL volunteers come from a variety of backgrounds with highly advanced skills from areas such as university/school teaching, TEFL/ESL instruction, psychology, anthropology, international studies, government & law, and non-profit governance, and are placed with a primary organization conducting the activities listed above in partnership with teachers, professors, & administrators.

It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months.\r\r\r\rArmenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat.

Although it is not guaranteed, most Primary English Teachers may expect to live in a family compound. The houses may be one- or two-roomed, thatched or corrugated iron-roofed buildings made of stone, brick, or cement blocks. Most houses do not have electricity or running water. Most Volunteers use an outdoor pit latrine and fetch water from a stand pipe in their home compound or from a village pump a few yards from their house. Some must go farther to find a source of water, carrying water back to their homes. Most secondary schools have their own teachers\u00d5 living quarters. \r\r\r\rThe terrain in Lesotho is mountainous and rocky. Volunteers walk long distances on rocky, uneven terrain. \r\r\r\rIf required for their job, a limited number of Volunteers (particularly Primary English Teachers) may receive bicycles depending on availability and safety and security considerations. It is more normal that Volunteers will walk from 2-6 kilometers before reaching their worksite or where they can access public transportation.\r\r\r\rVolunteers live and work either in camp towns or rural villages. They use public transport when shopping in camp towns to purchase food supplies and when traveling to activities in different parts of the district. The fares for buses and taxis are reasonable.  \r\r\r\rLesotho has four distinct seasons with hot summers to extremely cold winters. Snow falls every winter in the mountains and some foothills therefore, it is essential to bring warm, comfortable, and professional clothing. Schools are usually closed in winter and Volunteers are expected to use this time to engage more in development activities and secondary projects within their community.\r\r\r\rWhile Lesotho is generally a safe country, theft and violent crime exist, and Peace Corps Volunteers have been victims of these crimes, particularly in the capital and while taking public transportation. As a result, Peace Corps/Lesotho has implemented strict safety and security measures, including restricting Volunteers\u00d5 travel to the capital, Maseru.\r\r\r\rLesotho has the third highest HIV prevalence in the world, with nearly 24% of the adult population infected. This means that the majority of the Volunteers\u00d5 fellow teachers, neighbors, and students are affected by HIV; some are HIV-positive, while others may be orphaned and/or caring for family members living with HIV.
